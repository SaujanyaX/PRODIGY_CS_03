# PRODIGY_CS_03
For my third task during my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech, 
I was assigned to develop a basic Python program to evaluate the complexity or strength of a password. 
This program analyzes the given password based on various criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
By assessing these factors, the program determines whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong, helping users create more secure passwords.
